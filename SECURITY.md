## Reporting a Vulnerability

At SuomiNotes, we take security seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please do not post it publicly. Instead, report it to us following the steps below:

1. Email us at [security@suominotes.com](mailto:curtisthomas08@hotmail.co.uk) with detailed information about the vulnerability.
2. Wait for confirmation from one of the project maintainers.
3. Once confirmed, we will work with you to address the issue and provide proper credit for your discovery.

Please provide as much detail as possible, including:

- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the vulnerability
- Potential impact of the vulnerability
- Any additional information that could be helpful

We appreciate your help in making SuomiNotes a more secure project.
